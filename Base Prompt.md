You have already made the local folder and linked it to the GitHub repository and decided to host it on GitHub and think of using local storage to store data for now. So, you have to get the files like html, CSS, java script and other. file codes through an LLM. The app's function is to create a dedicated space for list, buy and sell household items that are no longer in use. Person should be able to list their item with a photo, name, description and contact information so the person looking at it can contact them and buy. After that, seller should be able to manually check the item as sold. Include other any basic feature that you think essential like date, time and other functions. What is the best prompt-engineered prompt that you are giving to the Large Language Model to achieve this task? Ask clarifying question if you have any doubts.
